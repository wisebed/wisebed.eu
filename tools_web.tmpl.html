            <h4>TARWIS</h4>

            <p>
                Although each testbed may differ with respect to hardware and software, all wireless sensor network
                testbeds
                require common functionalities. As every shared resource, a testbed needs a notion of users, it requires
                support
                for reprogramming and reconfiguration of the nodes, provisions to debug and remotely reset sensor nodes
                in case
                of node failures as well as a solution for collecting and storing experimental data.
            </p>

            <p>
                TARWIS targets at providing these functionalities independent from the node type and node operating
                system. The
                system has been designed to access and manipulate a testbed from within a website, in order to also let
                researchers access testbed resources remotely over the Internet, in order to share testbed resources
                with
                European research partners in a federation of testbeds. TARWIS hence relieves researchers setting up a
                sensor
                network testbed from the burden to implement their own scheduling and testbed management solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                TARWIS contains a number of different components, such as the TARWIS Server, the TARWIS GUI, the
                Reservation
                System, the Identity Provider (IDP) plus a web interface (IDP Tools), the Service Provider (SP), and
                Sensor
                Network Authorization System (SNA) plus a web interface (SNA GUI).
            </p>

            <p>
                TARWIS was available at every partner site during the projects runtime. Today TARWIS is still available
                for the
                testbed University of Bern (UBERN) at <a href="https://gridlab23.unibe.ch/portal/TARWIS/">https://gridlab23.unibe.ch/portal/TARWIS/</a>.
