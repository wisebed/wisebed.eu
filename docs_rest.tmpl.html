                The HTTP-based REST API is the modern version of the <a href="#docs_soap">WISEBED SOAP APIs</a>. All
                currently actively used and developed client applications (e.g., <a href="#tools_web">WiseGui</a>,
                <a href="#tools_desktop">wisebed.js-scripts</a>) are based on the REST API.
            </p>
            <p>
                The API is being developed as part of the testbed management software
                <a href="#tools_tr">Testbed Runtime</a>. Documentation of the API will be made available soon. Until
                then, please refer to the <a href="https://github.com/wisebed/wisebed.js">implementation of the
                wisebed.js</a> client library to learn about the API.
