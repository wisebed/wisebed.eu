                The WISEBED project is a joint effort of nine academic and research institutes across Europe. The
                project takes place between June 2008 to May 2011. It is funded by the European Commission under the
                Information Communication Technologies programme part of the Seventh Framework, as project number
                224460.

                are maintained by CORDIS, under the ICT section.

                The aim of this project is to provide a multi-level infrastructure of interconnected testbeds of
                large scale wireless sensor networks for research purposes, pursuing an interdisciplinary approach that
                integrates the aspects of hardware, software, algorithms, and data. This will demonstrate how
                heterogeneous small-scale devices and testbeds can be brought together to form well-organized,
                large-scale structures, rather than just some large network; it will allow research not only at a much
                larger scale, but also in different quality, due to heterogeneous structure and the ability to deal with
                dynamic scenarios, both in membership and location.

                For the interdisciplinary area of wireless sensor networks, establishing the foundations of distributed,
                interconnected testbeds for an integrated approach to hardware, software, algorithms, and data will
                allow a new quality of practical and theoretical collaboration, possibly marking a turning point from
                individual, hand-tailored solutions to large-scale, integrated ones. For this end, we will engage in
                implementing recent theoretical results on algorithms, mechanisms and protocols and transform them into
                software.
            </p>

            <p>
                We will apply the resulting code to the scrutiny of large-scale simulations and experiments, from which
                we expect to obtain valuable feedback and derive further requirements, orientations and inputs for the
                long-term research. We intend to make these distributed laboratories available to the European
                scientific community, so that other research groups will take advantage of the federated infrastructure.
                Overall, this means pushing the new paradigm of distributed, self-organizing structures to a different
                level.
