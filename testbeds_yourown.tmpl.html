                During the WISEBED project we developed a testbed management software called "Testbed Runtime" (TR). TR
                allows you to set up your own testbed within minutes.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can use it for your local desktop testbed or your research institutions testbed. It even can scale
                up to thousands of nodes! In fact, TR has also been used for experimentation and administration of the
                <a href="http://www.smartsantander.eu/">SmartSantander</a> smart city deployment!
