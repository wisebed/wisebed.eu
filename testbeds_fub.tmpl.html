            <h4>Testbed Description</h4>

            <p>
                The DES-Testbed is a hybrid wireless network testbed located on the campus of the Freie Universit채t
                Berlin. DES-Testbed comprises of 100 hybrid DES-Nodes consisting of a wireless mesh and a wireless
                sensor network as shown in Figure below. The network of mesh outers, called DES-Mesh nodes are deployed
                to act as a backbone and to facilitate the DES-WSN nodes. DES-WSN consists of a MSB-A2, with temperature
                and humidity sensors. Currently, DES-Testbed consists of 110 DES-Nodes with plans for future extensions.
                The objective of DES-Testbed is to provide a testbed to the user for development and evaluation of
                different algorithms, for WSN and WMN, using experimentation.

                Each router is equipped with three or more IEEE 802.11a/b/g network interface cards (NICs).
                Currently, we use one LogiLink WL0025 dongle based on the RT2501U architecture with an RT2571W
                BB/MAC IC and RT2528 RF IC. This NIC features an on-board R-SMA connector and a 4 dBi Hi-Gain
                antenna. The antennas are mounted at the side panels of the router using extension cables.
                Additionally, all mesh routers are equipped with two Atheros-based MiniPCI cards (WLM54SAG)
                connected with <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/antsmadb.htm">dual-band antennas</a>. The indoor
                nodes use a custom case that is manufactured at Freie Universit채t Berlin.

            <p>
                10 outdoor nodes are currently being deployed. They use the weather-proof
                <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/case2c4.htm" target="_blank">4A2E kit</a> and special
                <a href="http://www.pcengines.ch/antnr.htm" target="_blank">outdoor antennas</a>.

            <p>
                The primary Ethernet port of all nodes is used to boot the operating system over the network and to
                mount the root file system. The mesh routers have no need for local persistent memory and store
                their data on a central server. The mesh routers mainly are mains powered, but in locations that
                lack access to the power supply system, Power over Ethernet (PoE) adapters are used.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each mesh router is equipped with a <a href="ftp://ftp.inf.fu-berlin.de/pub/reports/tr-b-08-15.pdf">MSB-A2</a>
                sensor node (developed at Freie Universit채t Berlin) that is connected via a USB cable which provides
                power supply and is used to write firmware images to the flash memory.

            <p>
                The MSB-A2 sensor nodes use an <a href="http://www.nxp.com/pip/LPC2387_3.html">LPC2387</a>
                microcontroller produced by NXP Semiconductors. The frequency of the 32-bit ARM7 TDMI-S core based
                microcontroller can be dynamically configured at runtime to up to 72 MHz, depending on the sensor
                network application and energy requirements. The TI (formerly Chipcon)
                <a href="http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/cc1100.html">CC1100</a> transceiver uses the
                ISM band at 863 to 870 MHz with a maximum data rate of 500 kbit/s. The MSB-A2 nodes set up a
                wireless testbed in parallel to the mesh routers that is fully orthogonal to the frequency band used
                by IEEE 802.11.
