            <p>
                The original idea in the WISEBED project was to provide all testbed functionality via a standardized
                SOAP API. This API is identical for every testbed as well as for federated testbeds, allowing you to
                write
                WISEBED clients in literally any programming language that is capable of speaking Web Services according
                to the
                WS/I interoperability profile.

                Nowadays, there's also a "more modern" <a href="#docs_rest">HTTP-based REST API</a> that enabled the
                implementation of e.g., JavaScript-based client applications such as the <a href="#tools_web">WiseGui
                Web-based graphical frontend</a> or the <a href="#tools_desktop">wisebed.js-scripts</a> shell tools.

            <h4>Version 3.0</h4>

            <p>
                The current version 3.0 of the SOAP API WSDL files and documentation is being developed on github.com.
                The API didn't see a final official release yet but is already in production use at the LÃ¼beck testbed
                site and is part of the upcoming Testbed Runtime release 0.9. For more information please go to:

            <h4>Version 2.3</h4>

            <p>
                Version 2.3 of the WISEBED SOAP API (and its predecessors) was standardized during the project runtime.
                Below you'll find all necessary documentation which you still might find valuable as it is partially
                "more verbose" than the current versions documentation and explains the basic concepts quite nicely.
