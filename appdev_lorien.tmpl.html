                Lorien is an advanced operating environment for Wireless Sensor Networks providing unparalleled
                modularity and dynamic systems support. Lorien components can be individually added to and removed from
                sensor nodes while the system remains online with complete system integrity and strong type safety.
                Lorien also includes the Wisebed OS Abstraction layer allowing Lorien application components to execute
                unmodified on a range of platforms including the Shawn simulator.
