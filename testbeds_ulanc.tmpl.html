            <h4>Testbed Description</h4>

            <p>
                The WISEBED testbed of Lancaster University in the UK currently consists of 16 TelosB-type sensor nodes
                from MAXFOR. Each node has an SHT11 sensor as well as PAR and TSR light sensors.
            </p>

            <p>
                We currently employ netbooks as our backbone management network, with two sensor nodes connected to each
                netbook. The nodes are deployed across the first floor of the InfoLab21 building.
            </p>
