            <p>
                A set of command line scripts to execute, control and interact with your experiment using
                the WISEBED SOAP API v2.3. The scripts are based on the
                <a href="https://github.com/wisebed/scripting-client">Scripting Client</a> project that
                features a Java interpreter (BeanShell) and provides a pre-configured environment to the script to be
                executed.

            <h4>Spyglass</h4>

            <p>
                SpyGlass is a modular and extensible visualization framework for wireless sensor networks. The tool can
                visualize sensor nodes and communication links as well as information on the sensor values, link
                quality or any other data from the sensor node.
            </p>

            <p>
                SpyGlass implements the controller webservice from the iWSN API v2.3 to be able to receive messages from
                a sensor network. A user just start an experiment, start SpyGlass, authenticate itself and choose the
                active reservation.SpyGlass receives all messages from the running experiment and visualize the nodes
                with so called SpyGlassPacket.
            </p>

            <h4>WeyesBED</h4>

            <p>
                The WeyesBED visualization tool allows the visualization of WiseML files. The visualizer aims at
                seamless trace replay of an experiment described in WiseML, thus allowing interactive visual
                description, and representation of distributed algorithms and protocols. By being able to monitor every
                experiment state and their transitions, researchers will be able to gain better insight on the inner
                workings of their algorithms and potentially detect key-events that lead to problematic states or bugs.
            </p>

            <p>
                To keep the visualization application as portable as possible, the visualizer is written in Java and
                uses Java3D as the OpenGL frontend.
            </p>

            <p>
                In essence, WiseML models WSN testbeds as graphs. The visualizer extends this concept to three
                dimensions. An experiment is visualized as a graph in 3D space. Nodes are displayed as spheres and links
                as lines that connect spheres. The user can navigate in the 3D space using his mouse and keyboard to
                switch focus from one entity to a group of entities, or even to the whole network. When a graph entity
                is chosen, its capabilities are displayed on the right part of the screen. Trace navigation and replay
                is implemented by a video-like interface.
