                The Wiselib is an algorithms library for networked embedded devices. It contains various algorithm
                classes (for instance, localization or routing) that can be compiled for several platforms such as
                iSense or Contiki, or the sensor network simulator <a href="http://shawn.sf.net/">Shawn</a>. It is
                completely written in C++, and uses templates in the same way as
                <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost</a> and <a href="http://www.cgal.org/">CGAL</a>. This makes it
                possible to write generic and platform independent code that is very efficiently compiled for the
                various platforms.

                We provide easy-to-use interfaces to the OS, which simplifies the development process and decreases the
                need for dealing with low-level functionality of specific hardware platforms. Algorithms can even be run
                in a simulation environment first (for debugging purposes, for example), and then compiled for real
                hardware platforms without changing a single line of algorithm code.

                Not only we think Wiselib is awesome, apparently even Google does so. The Wiselib has been accepted as a
                mentoring organization <b>three years in a row</b> already (2014)!
