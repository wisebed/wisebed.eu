                Please note that the WISEBED project ended in May 2011. Some but not all of the testbeds are still
                operational and some but not all of the software solutions are still being developed. The information
                below might therefore be outdated. For more up-to-date information on this testbed please contact the

            <h4>Testbed Description</h4>

            <p>
                The testbed at the <a href="http://www.upc.edu/eng/" target="_blank">Technical University of
                Catalonia</a> is distributed around different rooms at the
                <a href="http://www.lsi.upc.edu/" target="_blank">Software Department</a> (building Omega, 2nd. floor),
                located in&nbsp;<a
                    href="http://maps.google.es/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=es&amp;geocode=&amp;q=campus+nord&amp;aq=&amp;sll=41.388762,2.112239&amp;sspn=0.047394,0.132093&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=campus+nord&amp;hnear=&amp;ll=41.38956,2.112207&amp;spn=0.045783,0.132093&amp;z=14"
                    target="_blank">Campus Nord</a>. The testbed consists currently of 10 iSense nodes in 5 rooms.
            </p>

            <p>
                The characteristics of UPC testbed nodes (iSense nodes by
                <a href="http://www.coalesenses.com/" target="_blank">coalesenses</a>) are the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Jennic 32-bit RISC Controller, 16MHz (JN5139R1)</li>
                <li>IEEE 802.15.4 compliant radio, 250 kbit/s, hardware AES Encryption</li>
                <li>High accuracy (20ppm) real time clock</li>
                <li>Software controllable voltage regulator</li>
                <li>High-gain SMA antenna</li>
                <li>Fixed Power Supply via USB Interface</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Additionally, and independently of the testbed itself, there is a dedicated pair of iSense sensors. One
                of them is equiped with a solar module and temperature and light sensors. Its function is to gather
                following data:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Controller voltage</li>
                <li>Supply voltage</li>
                <li>Battery voltage</li>
                <li>Battery charge</li>
                <li>Battery current</li>
                <li>Battery temperature</li>
                <li>Charge status</li>
                <li>Power source (basically wether there's solar power available)</li>
                <li>Environmental temperature</li>
                <li>Environmental light</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                It samples all this data every minute and sends it to the second sensor by radio. This sensor is
                connected to a computer via USB. It formats and sends the data to the computer through the USB port.
            </p>
